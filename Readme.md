## Technologies Used

Synaptics AI is built using a modern and efficient technology stack:

* **Frontend:** [React](https://react.dev/)
* **Backend:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
* **AI Integration:** [Google AI](https://ai.google/) (e.g., Gemini API, etc.)
* **(Add any other specific libraries/frameworks/databases you use, e.g., Express.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, etc.)**

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run Synaptics AI on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
* npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://[https://github.com/CodeWithAyush2710/Synaptics-AI.git](https://github.com/CodeWithAyush2710/Synaptics-AI.git)
    cd Synaptics-AI
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend # Navigate into your frontend directory
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    cd .. # Go back to the root directory
    ```

3.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend # Navigate into your backend directory
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    cd .. # Go back to the root directory
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in your `backend` directory and add your API keys and configuration settings.

    ```
    # Example .env for backend
    PORT=5000
    GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
    # Add any other necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, other API keys)
    ```
    * Replace `your_google_ai_api_key` with your actual Google AI API key.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    The backend server should start on the port specified in your `.env` file (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    In a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    This will open the application in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

* **Generate Cold Emails:** Navigate to the email generation section, provide your inputs (e.g., recipient details, purpose, key points), and let the AI draft a compelling email for you.
* **Review Code:** Upload or paste your code snippets into the code review tool to receive AI-powered suggestions and analysis.
* **(Add specific steps for any other features you implement)**
